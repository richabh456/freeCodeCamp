Docker is basically a container engine which uses the linux kernel features like namespace and control groups to create container on top of an operating system and automates application deployment on the container.
working of Docker:it has a client-server architecture ,docker server is responsible for all the actions that are related to containers .the daemon recieves the command from, the docker client through CLI or REST API'S
DOCKER client can be on the same host as a daemon or it can be present on any other host.images are the building blocks of docker .containers are built from images ,images can be configured with applications and used as a template for creating containers,,it is organised in a layered fashion .every change in an image is added as a layer on top of it.
